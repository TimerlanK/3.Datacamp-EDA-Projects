# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?<br/>

Well, let's find out! What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice?...

# The GitHub History of the Scala Language
Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. </br>
In this project, we will be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). </br>
With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. </br>
You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts. </br>

The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

# The_android_app_market
<p>
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. 
</p>
The data files are as follows:
* apps.csv: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.
* user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first.
